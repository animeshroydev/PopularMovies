### *Implemented following features in _Stage 1_ of App:*
* Present the user with a grid arrangement of movie posters upon launch.
* Allow your user to change sort order via a setting:
* The sort order can be by most popular or by highest-rated
* Allow the user to tap on a movie poster and transition to a details screen with additional information such as:
* original title
* movie poster image thumbnail
* A plot synopsis (called overview in the api)
* user rating (called vote_average in the api)
* release date


### *Implemented following features in _Stage 2_ of App:*
* Allow users to view and play trailers ( either in the youtube app or a web browser).
* Allow users to read reviews of a selected movie.
* Also allow users to mark a movie as a favorite in the details view by tapping a button(star).
* Create a database to store the names and ids of the user's favorite movies (and optionally, the rest of the information needed to display their favorites collection while offline).
* Modify the existing sorting criteria for the main view to include an additional pivot to show their favorites collection.

### Implementation:
:red_circle: *Generate an API key from [_theMovieDB API_](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) and paste it in Constant.java*
